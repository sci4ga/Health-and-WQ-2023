This is a dataset and analysis created by David White in Spring of 2023 for his Master's thesis. 

The purpose of this project was to create a Shiny App where Water Quality Data was matched to Health Outcome Data in the state of Georgia.

There are three main datasets. They can be found in the Data Repository in the "WQ and Chem - UGA Spring 2023" Directory. In that directory are the 3 data catalogue files. 
- Potential Harmful Chemicals from WQP - this is a high level spreadsheet explaining what each row in "Water Quality Data Final" is - the Type the Data is, and the High / Medium / Low for risk to human health and the interest to Sci4Ga
- Health Quality Outcome Data
- Water Quality Data Final
